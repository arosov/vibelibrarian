# Project Conventions for Aider

This document outlines the key conventions and architectural guidelines for this project. Aider should adhere to these principles when generating or modifying code.

## 1. Project Structure & Technology

* **Type:** Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project.
* **Goal:** Maximize code sharing across platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, JVM, JS) using `commonMain`, `commonTest`, and platform-specific source sets (`androidMain`, `iosMain`, `jvmMain`, `jsMain`, etc.).
* **Build System:** Gradle with Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`). Use Gradle Version Catalogs (`libs.versions.toml`) for dependency management.

## 2. Version Control & CI/CD

* **Hosting:** The codebase is hosted on **GitHub**.
* **CI/CD:** All Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines **must** be implemented using **GitHub Actions**.
    * Workflows should be defined in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
    * Common tasks include building, linting, running tests (unit and integration), and potentially deploying artifacts.

## 3. Cloud Infrastructure

* **Provider:** **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is the preferred cloud provider.
* **Cost Optimization:** Prioritize using services within the **GCP Free Tier** whenever feasible.
    * Before suggesting or implementing a GCP service, consider its free tier limits (e.g., Cloud Functions invocation counts, Firestore read/writes, Cloud Run CPU-seconds, Cloud Storage limits).
    * If the Free Tier is insufficient, select cost-effective managed services. Document the reasons if non-free tier usage is necessary.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** While not strictly required by this document *yet*, prefer IaC tools like Terraform if managing infrastructure becomes complex.

## 4. Architecture: Clean Architecture

* **Core Principle:** The project structure and dependency flow **must** adhere to **Clean Architecture** principles.
* **Layers:** Maintain distinct layers:
    * **Domain:** Core business logic, entities, use cases (interactors), and repository interfaces. **Crucially, this layer must have ZERO external dependencies.** No frameworks, no platform specifics, no infrastructure details (database, network, etc.). It should be pure Kotlin, primarily residing in `commonMain`.
    * **Application/Use Cases:** (Often part of Domain or a thin layer above it) Orchestrates use cases, depends only on the Domain layer.
    * **Infrastructure/Data:** Implementation details. Includes data sources (network clients, databases, device storage), framework implementations, etc. Implements interfaces defined in the Domain layer. Depends on Domain.
    * **Presentation/UI:** Platform-specific UI and presentation logic (e.g., Android Activities/Fragments/Composables, iOS ViewControllers/SwiftUI Views, Web components). Depends on Application/Use Cases or ViewModels derived from them.
* **Dependency Rule:** Dependencies flow inwards. Outer layers (UI, Infrastructure) depend on inner layers (Domain). The Domain layer depends on nothing external to itself.

## 5. Kotlin Code Style & Organization

* **Style Guide:** Follow the official Kotlin coding conventions ([https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)). If targeting Android, also adhere to the Android Kotlin Style Guide.
* **Feature Modules:**
    * Most distinct features **should be isolated** into their own **Gradle modules**.
    * These feature modules should reside under a top-level `features/` directory (e.g., `features/authentication`, `features/user-profile`).
    * **Internal Architecture:** Each feature module **should itself** strive to implement Clean Architecture internally (e.g., `features/authentication/domain`, `features/authentication/data`, `features/authentication/presentation`). The scope might be smaller, but the layering and dependency rules still apply within the module.
    * **Dependencies:** Feature modules can depend on core/shared modules (e.g., a `core/common` or `core/domain` module) but should generally avoid direct dependencies on *other* feature modules. Use shared interfaces or event mechanisms defined in common modules for inter-feature communication if necessary.
* **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures (`val`, `listOf`, `mapOf`, immutable data classes) where possible.
* **Coroutines:** Use Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations. Utilize structured concurrency.
* **Nullability:** Leverage Kotlin's null-safety features correctly. Avoid unnecessary nullable types and the non-null asserted (`!!`) operator.

## 6. Dependencies

* **KMP Compatibility:** Ensure added dependencies are KMP-compatible or provide necessary `expect`/`actual` implementations.
* **Management:** Use Gradle Version Catalogs (`libs.versions.toml`) to define and manage dependency versions centrally.

## 7. Testing

* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for business logic (Domain layer, Use Cases) and Presentation logic (ViewModels). Place common tests in `commonTest`. These should be fast and have no external dependencies (use fakes or mocks).
* **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for interactions between layers (e.g., Use Case interacting with a repository implementation).
* **Platform-Specific Tests:** UI tests (Espresso, XCUITest) and tests requiring platform APIs belong in platform-specific test source sets (e.g., `androidTest`, `iosTest`).
* **Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage, especially in the Domain layer.

## 8. Documentation

* **KDoc:** Write KDoc comments for all public APIs (classes, functions, properties) and complex internal logic.
* **READMEs:** Ensure `README.md` files are present and updated for the main project and significant modules (especially feature modules).

## 9. Aider-Specific Instructions

* **Consult this File:** Always refer to these conventions before generating or modifying code.
* **Clarify Ambiguity:** If a request is unclear or conflicts with these conventions, ask for clarification.
* **Prioritize Conventions:** Adherence to these architectural and structural rules is paramount, even if it requires more verbose code than a simpler, less structured approach.
* **Explain Choices:** When making significant architectural decisions (e.g., adding a new module, choosing a specific GCP service), briefly explain the reasoning in the context of these conventions.
